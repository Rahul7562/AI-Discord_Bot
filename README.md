## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Download the Project

Download or clone this project to your computer and save it in a folder.

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
pip install openai discord.py
```

This installs the necessary libraries for the bot to work.

### Step 3: Set Up Your API Keys

Open the files and add your API keys:

**In `AI_API.py`:**
- Find `"Your_api_key"` (appears twice for Perplexity)
- Replace it with your actual Perplexity API key
- Find `"your_api_key"` (for Gemini)
- Replace it with your actual Google Gemini API key

**In `bot_api.py`:**
- Find `"your_discord_bot_token_here"`
- Replace it with your Discord bot token

### Step 4: Create Your Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Go to the "Bot" section and click "Add Bot"
4. Under "TOKEN", click "Copy" to get your bot token (paste this in `bot_api.py`)
5. Enable "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT" under Privileged Gateway Intents
6. Go to "OAuth2" ‚Üí "URL Generator"
7. Select scopes: `bot`
8. Select permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Messages/View Channels`
9. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to add the bot to your server

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the bot with:

```bash
python bot_api.py
```

4. You should see a message: `YourBotName has connected to Discord!`

## üí¨ How to Use the Bot

Once your bot is online in your Discord server, you can interact with it using commands:

### Basic Command Format

```
-ask [image_path] [your question]
```

### Examples

**Ask a text-only question:**
```
-ask none What is the capital of France?
```

**Ask a question with an image:**
```
-ask https://example.com/image.jpg What's in this image?
```

The bot will:
1. Respond with "Processing your request..."
2. Send the AI's response to your question

## üîß How It Works

### AI_API.py
This file contains the main AI function that:
- Connects to AI models (Perplexity Sonar or Google Gemini)
- Sends your questions (with or without images) to the AI
- Returns the AI's response

**Supported Models:**
- `sonar` - Perplexity's standard model (great for general questions)
- `sonar-pro` - Perplexity's advanced model (more detailed responses)
- `gemini-2.5-flash` - Google's Gemini Flash model (fast and efficient)

### bot_api.py
This file runs the Discord bot that:
- Listens for commands in your Discord server
- Takes your question and passes it to the AI
- Sends back the AI's response in Discord

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Keep Your API Keys Secret**: Never share your API keys or bot token publicly
- **API Limits**: Free API tiers have usage limits. Check your provider's documentation
- **Image URLs**: When using images, make sure the URL is publicly accessible
- **Internet Required**: The bot needs an active internet connection to work

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Make sure the bot is online (check Discord server member list)
- Verify "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT" is enabled in Discord Developer Portal
- Check that your command starts with `-ask`

**"Model not supported" error:**
- Check that you're using one of the three supported models in the code

**API errors:**
- Verify your API keys are correct
- Check if you've exceeded your free tier limits
- Ensure you have an active internet connection

## üîê Security Tips

- Never commit API keys to GitHub or public repositories
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive information in production
- Regularly rotate your API keys and bot tokens

## üìù Customization

You can customize the bot by editing `AI_API.py`:
- Change the chatbot personality by modifying the system prompt
- Adjust response styles (concise vs. detailed)
- Add more AI models by following the existing pattern
